## ⚠️ Note on Official Documentation

The official Ruijie documentation (both printed manual and online: [ruijienetworks.com](https://www.ruijienetworks.com/support/documents/slide_76367/#_Toc184226047)) listed the drill spacing for the RG-AP820-L(V2) ceiling mount bracket as **26.5mm center-to-center**.

However, based on physical measurements from actual brackets included in the product box, I originally found the correct spacing to be **55mm center-to-center**. This was later confirmed by Ruijie's RD team to be **53mm**, and they acknowledged the error in their published documents.
