## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Official Documentation

The official Ruijie documentation (both printed manual and online: [ruijienetworks.com](https://www.ruijienetworks.com/support/documents/slide_76367/#_Toc184226047)) lists the drill spacing for the RG-AP820-L(V2) ceiling mount bracket as **26.5mm center-to-center**.

However, based on physical measurements from actual brackets included in the product box, I found the correct spacing to be approximately **55mm center-to-center**.

This template reflects the corrected measurements to ensure successful mounting.

I've not checked the other models yet, but they might have the same issue or might not. This repo and template are made just to make it easier to drill on the ceiling and mount quickly and accurately.

This repo was built to help speed up rollout and reduce measurement errors during deployment of Ruijie wireless access points.
