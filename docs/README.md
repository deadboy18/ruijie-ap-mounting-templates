## ⚠️ Note on Official Documentation

The original Ruijie documentation (manual & online: [ruijienetworks.com](https://www.ruijienetworks.com/support/documents/slide_76367/#_Toc184226047)) listed the drill spacing for the RG-AP820-L(V2) bracket as **26.5mm center-to-center**.

Based on physical measurements of the actual bracket, I originally found the correct spacing to be **55mm**.  
Ruijie has now officially confirmed it should be **53mm**, and stated that documentation will be updated.
